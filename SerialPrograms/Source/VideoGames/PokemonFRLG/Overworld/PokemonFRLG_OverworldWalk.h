/*  Overworld Walk
 *
 *  From: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/
 *
 *  Walks a planned overworld route with the D-pad. FRLG moves one tile per
 *  16 frames and finishes a step once it starts, so a leg is one hold timed
 *  to land mid-way between the last tile and one more. Warps are waited out
 *  by their fade; Surf goes through its dialog.
 *
 *  A message or a wild battle can stop the player part-way through a leg.
 *  Each kind is an OverworldInterrupt: the walker watches for all of them
 *  while it holds the D-pad, and when one shows it stops, has it cleared and
 *  walks the rest of the leg.
