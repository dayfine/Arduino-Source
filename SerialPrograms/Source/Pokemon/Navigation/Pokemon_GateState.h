/*  Gate State
 *
 *  From: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/
 *
 *  Which of the maps' gates (MapData::gates) are open: the card-key doors
 *  the player has opened, and the state of each switch. A switch is shared
 *  by every map that lists it as a floor (Pokemon Mansion's statue
 *  switch), and every gate that follows it is open or closed with it.
 *
 *  The state is plain data, with no map in it; the story keeps it
 *  (Pokemon_StoryCheckpoint.h). What it makes of a map's tiles is
 *  Pokemon_GateTiles.h, and the gated planner (Pokemon_GatedPlanner.h)
 *  searches over it.
